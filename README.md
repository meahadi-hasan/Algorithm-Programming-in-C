##Algorithms

Bellman Ford:
The Bellman Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Breadth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

Fractional Knapsack:
The Fractional Knapsack problem is a variation of the Knapsack problem where items can be broken into smaller pieces.

0/1 Knapsack:
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a variation of the Knapsack problem where each item must either be taken or not taken as a whole.
